Integer type 
 - Signed and unsigned refer to whether it’s possible for the number to be negative—in other words, whether the number 
 needs to have a sign with it (signed) or whether it will only ever be positive and can therefore be represented 
 without a sign (unsigned). 
 - Integer overflow -    variable of type u8 that can hold values between 0 and 255. 
 If you try to change the variable to a value outside that range, such as 256, integer overflow will occur
Floating-Point Types
 - Rust’s floating-point types are f32 and f64, which are 32 bits and 64 bits in size
 - numeric operations: additions, subtraction, multiplication, division, remainder
Boolean Types
 - bool:true or false
Character Types
