if expressions
 -  fn main() {
      let number = 3;

      if number < 5 {
          println!("condition was true");
      } else {
          println!("condition was false");
      }
  }
use multiple conditions by combining if and else in an else if expression
 - fn main() {
        let number = 6;

        if number % 4 == 0 {
            println!("number is divisible by 4");
        } else if number % 3 == 0 {
            println!("number is divisible by 3");
        } else if number % 2 == 0 {
            println!("number is divisible by 2");
        } else {
            println!("number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2");
        }
    }
use if in a let statement
 - fn main() {
        let condition = true;
        let number = if condition { 5 } else { 6 };

        println!("The value of number is: {number}");
    }
 - values that have the potential to be results from each arm of the if must be the same type
 - this code causes an error:
    fn main() {
        let condition = true;

        let number = if condition { 5 } else { "six" };

        println!("The value of number is: {number}");
    }
repetition with loops
 - rust has 3 kinds of loops: loop, while, and for
